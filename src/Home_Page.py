            \n* Value is calculated by taking the $6.99 bond price and dividing
            the bond gold exchange price to get the USD to 1 gold piece rate.

            casting high alchemy on the item, and subtracting the item's
            Grand Exchange price and subtracting 1 nature rune's Grand
            Exchange price.
