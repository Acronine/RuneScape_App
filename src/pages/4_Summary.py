        The purpose of this application is to create an dashboard using the
        RuneScape Wiki Api. The first steps to do this was pulling the data,
        cleaning the data, pushing the data to MongoDB. After, I created a
        virtual environment that will house all of my python installs and
        the application. Following, I query the data and run it through
        Streamlit. I then create an easily accessible application that allows
        the user to look up any item on the Grand Exchange and its
        corresponding info.

        In addition to the item's info, the next page allows the user to view
        the top 10 - 50 profitable items through casting high alchemy on
        bought items. Afterwards, the price history page lets the user
        view the price history of any item recently sold on the Grand Exchange.
        They can also change the time increments to view from the last 1,825 
        minutes to the last whole year of sales of the selected item as a line
        chart.
